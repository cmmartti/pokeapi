<h2 id="fairuse">Fair Use Policy</h2>
<p>PokéAPI is free and open to use. It is also very popular. Because of this, we ask <strong>every developer</strong> to abide by our fair use policy. People not complying with the fair use policy will have their IP address permenantly banned.</p>
<p>PokéAPI is primarily an educational tool, and we will not tolerate denial of service attacks preventing people from learning.</p>
<p>Rules:</p>
	<ol>
		<li>Locally cache resources and images when ever you request them.</li>
		<li>Do not spam the entire service to scrape all the data at once - use the paginated pages.</li>
		<li>Use the correct user-agent header in API requests.</li>
		<li>Be nice and friendly to your fellow PokéAPI developer.</li>
	</ol>
